I chose to add a counter to the while loop inside of the map function and wrote that to map.txt. 
I created a static variable for the counter outside the map function in the TokenizerMapper function and made the counter 
increase by one at the top of the map function that way anytime the map function was called the counter would increase. 
The number that I got for the number of  times the map method was invoked was 258.
